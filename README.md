# TESL java sdk

This version is standalone, and will require releases to fix cards or add new ones.

Similar to https://github.com/markjfisher/elder-scrolls-legends-sdk-java but holds cards locally and doesn't require
the external API https://elderscrollslegends.io.

This is just to be able to react to card fixes quicker.
